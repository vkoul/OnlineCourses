## Computation thinking- Univ of Michigan


### Computational Thinking Overview
- Problem solving approaches for computers to use to solve problems
- Computers are now ubiquotous, they are used to solve our problems
- In order to computers to help us, we need to tell them - we do this using programming
- Computer program is a set of instuctions to solve problems- We can do it in many languages like `Python`, `C`
- Although programming is not the first step, we need to develop a conceptual approach to solve the problem 
- Computational thinking is essentially the blueprint to solve a problem 
	- Is the problem solvable by the computer
	- Can we break the problems into sub-problems
	- Can we see familar patterns/ characteristics
	- Can we identify non essential aspects which we can ignore

### Computational Thinking Mental Models
	- **Problem Identification**
	- **Decomposition**
	- **Pattern Recoginication**
	- **Abstraction**
-  Subjective problems like, "what is the funniest movie?". These kind of problems are not solved by computers

- In problem identification, we work on :
	- Topic: What is the big problem which we are working on to solve
	- Data: What is the data which we require to solve the problem
	- Feasibility: Can you solve the problem with current information? Is the problem solveable with a computer

- Problem Decomposition: 
	- Can we break the big problem into sub-problems?
	- Tree charts and flow charts can help us do this well
	- Solving the sub-problems will help us solve the big problem

- Pattern Recoginition
	- Can we think of familiar patterns or characteristics which can help us solve the problems?
	- How are the sub-problems similar or dis-similar to the other problems which you have solved? 

- Abstraction 
	- Identify and ignore the non-essential parts of our problems which we can ignore
	- Are some parts essential to solve the problems or we can get rid of it
	- Worrying too much about the non-essential companents would lead to doing too much at the expense of a successful problem solving

#### Example of computational thinking

**Baking a cake for Grandmother's Birthday Party**

- This is a very high level overview of the problem, so we would need some clarifying answers to get more clarity on this. Some questions can help like:
	- What kind of cake does she like?
	- Does she have an allergy to anything?
	- Any decorations on the cake?
	- How many folks are coming?
	- When is the party (time-deadline)?

- There are multiple sub-problems, for which we need to develop the conceptual solutions:
	- Cake Algorithm
	- Frosting Algorithm
	- Presentation Algorithm
	- Transportation Algorithm
- After breaking down the whole process in the above steps, we need to write the corresponding program for the computer to act on it
- The whole problem solving could be linear in process or it can also be parallel in nature
- Sometimes, you need to solve the sub-problems in some order and sometimes, the order of solving the sub problems doesn't matter
