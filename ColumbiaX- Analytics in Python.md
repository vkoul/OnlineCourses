## Week 1 Notes- Python 

* Division of two `int` in python always gives out a `float `
* Strings are not mutable 
* `strings.find()` can be used to fetch the location of a particular text in a string
* The variables in python just store the location of an item,  so if x = 5 and y = 5. In the background, the x and y will point to the same address
	* The address can be identified by using `id` command. `id(x)`
