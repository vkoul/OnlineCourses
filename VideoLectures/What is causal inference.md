[ What is causal inference, and why should data scientists know? by Ludvig Hultt]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFp2Ou52-po](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFp2Ou52-po)).

* Data scientists now are just not interested in the statistical patterns, they are interested in the causal structures underlying the data 
* Casual Inference --> Drawing conclusions about cause and effect 

#### Characteristion 
* We know that correlation is not causation 
* However, we also have **Reichenbach's Common Cause Principle** 
	* if two things A and B are dependent on then either:
		* A causes B 
		* B causes A 
		* a third variable causes A and B
