## Goals
- Become a pro in Python :snake: programming language
- Ability to write ML and Stats algos from scratch in Python 

I have noted down resources (free :free: and paid :moneybag:)  which will help me master the different aspects of ML. This is an exhaustive list and currently I am concerned with introductory ML stuff. It contains both paid and free resources. Attempting to do all of them will take many months/years. Learners can focus on the ones which look interesting to them. 
There are also many excellent books by Springer, Manning and Oreilly. I have not included them currently.

### University Materials 
 
 ### Harvard / Stanford / MIT / NYU / Caltech Courses
The Data Science master program essentially amounts to 10-12 graduate level courses. The US options are pretty expensive. There are also online offerings now, that despite being cheaper than the on-campus version are expensive especially for the developing country learners. 
I am noting down top notch (as per me) courses from the Top US universities. If one manages to complete them all, it essentially is equivalent to studying for a masters degree in data science
