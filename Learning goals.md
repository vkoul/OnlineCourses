## Goals
- Become a pro in Python :snake: programming language
- Ability to write ML and Stats algos from scratch in Python 

I have noted down resources which will help me master the different aspects of ML. This is an exhaustive list and right now it is concerned with introductory ML stuff. It contains both paid and free resources. Attempting to do all of them will take many months/years. Learners can focus on the ones which look interesting to them. 
There are also many excellent books by Springer, Manning and Oreilly. I have not included them currently.

 ### Harvard / Stanford / MIT / NYU / Caltech Courses
The Data Science master program essentially amounts to 10-12 graduate level courses. The US options are pretty expensive. There are also online offerings now, that despite being cheaper than the on-campus version are expensive especially for the developing country learners. 
I am noting down top notch (as per me) courses from the Top US universities. If one manages to complete them all, it essentially is equivalent to studying for a masters degree in data science
