### Coursera

#### Stats/ Python/ Computational Thinking
 - [ ] 1) Python Programming - University of Michigan  
 - [ ] 2) Statistics in Python - University of Michigan  
 - [ ] 3) Computational Thinking - University of Michigan  

#### Applied Data Science / ML
 - [ ] 4) Applied Data Science in Python - University of Michigan
 - [ ] 5) Python products - UC San Diego 

#### Maths
 - [ ] 6) Math for Data Science - HSE
 - [ ] 7) Math for ML - Imperial

#### ML
 - [ ] 8) ML in Python - Stanford

 - [ ] 10) Intro to ML (HSE) *
 - [ ] 11) ML and Data Analysis Specialisation (MIPT)* 

\* HSE and MIPT courses are in Russian. However, they are in collaboration with Yandex and have one of the best balanced practical exercises. The plan is to just attempt the exercises.

 ### Harvard / Stanford / MIT / NYU / Caltech Courses
The Data Science master program essentially amounts to 10-12 graduate level courses. The US options are pretty expensive. There are also online offerings now, that despite being cheaper than the on-campus version are expensive especially for the developing country learners. 
I am noting down top notch (as per me) courses from the Top US universities. If one manages to complete them all, it essentially is equivalent to studying for a masters degree in data science
